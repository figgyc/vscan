# vscan
vscan is my personal "make documents look scanned" type tool. Right now it doesn't work perfectly, and eventually I will get time to improve the emulation, but for now I think it's good enough.

I only really put it on GitHub for ease of my personal deployments but if you want to use it go ahead.
